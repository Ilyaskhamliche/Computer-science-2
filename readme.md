In this program I was tasked with displaying an NFL roster with the players names position and number. Additionally, asked to use abstract methods. I took it upon myself to inplement some virtual classes which are a subset of abstract methods that allow abstract classes the ability to provide a way to express the commonality among derived classes without specifying the implementation details. I was then tasked with creating a menu driven program that that allows me to add additional players to my program.
