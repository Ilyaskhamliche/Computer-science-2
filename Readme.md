in this program I was asked create a hierarchy of classes and displays different beverages. Additionally I was then tasked with displaying some features of the the beverages including: calories, the price of the beverage, serving size, whether it was hot or cold, the roast type ie: dark roast, french roast, etc, and the brand of the beverage; coke-cola, sprite, things of that nature. I had to then make sure that i used setter/getter methods, a toString() method, along with an parameterized constructor.
