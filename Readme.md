In this assignment I was tasked with creating two programs in which I create a modular progam that allows the user to input quiz score. In the main I create an array that allows for 16 different quizscores for a semester long class. the user will be asked to input 16 different module scores. Once that it is done the compiler will output the average grade, the lowest quiz score, and the highest quiz score. For the second part of the assignment I was tasked with creating a a program that tracks my companys computer inventory. I created a while loop that allows the user to input all the necessary parameters for a computer along with input buffer that bypasses any breaks or newline characters.
