in this program I was asked create an object and display it. That object being a nerf gun. I was then tasked with displaying some features of the the nerfgun including: the model, range, capacity, and the number of the darts. I had to then make sure that the capacity of the nerfgun did not exceed 144 bullets. using overload operators such as ==, and += these allowed me to output four blasters.
